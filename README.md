# imageOperator
This is the simple but original, keep updated image operator created to help everybody do some image operation on the internet or the local. 

We try to get to know the original operation process of image, in the path of knowing deeper, we'll try to make our demo program 
work more efficiency, with more fluency. 

If there's any good things/usage that you can think of, please remind us, and we'll help to modify it and make it better.
